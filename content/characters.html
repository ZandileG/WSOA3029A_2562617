    <li class="list-title">Personality:</li> 
    <li class="list-item">Jake is a charismatic character. He's funny, competitive, and always raises people's spirits with his jokes and pranks. 
    What I like most about Jake is that he really cares about his friends and family and throughout the series we see him go from being immature 
    to being a kind, loyal and thoughtful person.</li>

    <li class="list-title">Personality:</li> 
    <li class="list-item">Amy is a very relatable character (well, to me at least). She's a know-it-all/nerd character who loves being organised 
    and doing things by the book. She's also a bit of a teacher's pet because most of the things she does is to impress the captain. Overall, Amy 
    is a great character and I like that she is not written as a one dimensional nerd character but there are layers to her personality.</li>

    <li class="list-item">Captain</li>

    <li class="list-title">Personality:</li> 
    <li class="list-item">Apart from Gina (seen below) Captain Holt is my favourite character. He's a well-written, complex character with an 
    amazing storyline throughout the series. He is a gay, black character, and I like that the writers did not make him a stereotypically 
    flambouyant person nor did they make him a steroetypical "stern/scary" black man. They instead made him a funny, empathetic, and devoted 
    character and his interactions with other characters are always a fun watch.</li>

        <li class="list-item">Assistant</li>

        <li class="list-title">Personality:</li> 
        <li class="list-item">Gina is my number one favourite character. She's very funny, a bit narcissistic, but overall she's a good person. 
        Gina can also be a bit delusional at times but she exudes confidence that makes people believe the things she is saying even when she's 
        lying. What I love most about this character is that she is unhinged. She does and says whatever she wants and people, usually, don't 
        question her.</li>

    <li class="list-item">Detective</li>

    <li class="list-title">Personality:</li> 
    <li class="list-item">Charles is a really funny character. When I watch an episode of the show and he's on the screen, I just know that
    I will be laughing at any moment. I also enjoy his confidence in himself because he doesn't let anyone tell what him what he can't do even 
    when we as the audience know that he actually can't do it. And lastly, I find his loyalty to Jake to be really sweet and his obsession with 
    Jake and Amy's relationship super relatable.</li>

    <li class="list-title">Personality:</li> 
    <li class="list-item">Rosa is pretty chilled character. She likes being by herself and minding her own business and it's sometimes hard for 
    her to trust people. Rosa is also a bisexual character and after she comes out she becomes more open around her friends and family. In 
    general, I like how her character has grown throughout the seasons.</li>

    <li class="list-title">Occupation:</li> 
    <li class="list-item">Lieutenant</li>

    <li class="list-title">Personality:</li> 
    <li class="list-item">Terry is a wholesome character. He really cares about his family and friends and when he's at work, he can't stop 
    talking about his kids. Terry is also good at giving advice and always lends a helping hand when his co-workers need anything. What I enjoy 
    most about Tery Jeffords is that this character is similar to the other comedic roles that Terry Crews has played before but he has more 
    layers to his personality and actually feels like a real person not just an archetype.</li>
