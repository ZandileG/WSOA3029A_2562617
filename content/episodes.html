    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p class="episode-title">PB & J</p>
    <p>"PB & J" is the 5th episode of the eighth season of the American television police sitcom series Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and the 148th overall
    episode of the series. The episode was written by co-producer Lamar Woods and Jeff Topolski and directed by Gail Mancuso. Trudy Judy visits 
    Jake at the precinct to inform him that Doug Judy has been arrested in Trenton, New Jersey. Jake decides to transport Doug to prison, hoping 
    to enjoy one last adventure together in a Pontiac Trans Am, where they wear matching "PB & J" rings. However, Boyle warns Jake not to trust 
    Doug, who eventually admits he plans to escape. They engage in a trivia contest, where Jake's failure to answer a question allows Doug to 
    leverage their friendship for a potential getaway. As they travel, Doug tricks Jake into changing their destination, leading them to be 
    ambushed by henchmen hired by Trudy. In a twist, Doug helps Jake fend off the attackers, resulting in their capture. Two weeks later, Jake 
    learns that Doug has escaped to Amsterdam, hinting that their hug may have facilitated his escape, but they reaffirm their friendship 
    despite the circumstances (Wikipedia).</p>
