    <h2>My Favourite Episode</h2>
    <section class="episode-container">    
    <div class="episode-info">
    <h3 class="episode-title">"Admiral Peralta"</h3>
    <p>This is episode 10 of season 7 which is the 140th episode in the whole series. It was written by Neil Campbell and directed by Linda 
        Mendoza (IMDb, 2020).</p>
    <p>The episode starts with Jake and Amy announcing their pregnancy at the precinct. Their co-workers are not surprised though because Amy was
        not good at hiding it. The main plot follows Jake when he invites his father, Roger, and estranged grandfather, Walter to the gender 
        reveal party. Their bonding time then turns chaotic when Roger and Walter accidentally drop the gender reveal cake. This causes the three 
        men to try to clean up the cake blindfolded (to avoid seeing the colour inside the cake). However, they make an even bigger mess. The gender 
        reveal then happens and more chaos ensues. Towards the end of episode Jake surprises Amy with another cake, since she didn't end up 
        knowing what the baby's gender is and they find out that they're having a boy. (On the right is a clip from the episode).</p> 
    
    <p>This is my favourite episode because it is an amalgamation of all my favourite things about the show. It is funny, chaotic, it has some 
        lighthearted moments, and it is centered around Peraltiago (Jake & Amy's couple name). No matter how many times I watch it, this episode 
        never gets old, and with each watch, I find something new to laugh at. In general, the episode was well-written and directed and the 
        actors performances were very convincing, which led to my overall enjoyment.</p></div>
