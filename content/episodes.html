    <p class="episode-title">Admiral Peralta</p>
    <p>"Admiral Peralta" is the 10th episode of the seventh season of the American television police sitcom series Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and the 
        140th overall episode of the series. The episode was written by Neil Campbell and directed by Linda Mendoza. It aired on April 2, 2020, 
        on NBC. Jake and Amy announce their pregnancy at the precinct, but the squad's lack of surprise hints that Amy had revealed it earlier. 
        Jake invites his estranged father, Roger, to the gender reveal party, hoping to mend the rift between him and Jake's grandfather, 
        Admiral Walter. As tensions rise, their attempts at bonding through shared grief turn chaotic when they accidentally reveal the baby's 
        sex while trying to clean a spilled cake. The reveal party ends in disaster, with Roger injuring himself, but he ultimately acknowledges 
        Jake's potential as a father (Wikipedia).</p> 
    
    <p>Why is it my favourite. Below is a clip from the episode.</p>
