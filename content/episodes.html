    <h2>My Favourite Episode</h2>
    <section class="episode-container">    
    <div class="episode-info">
    <h3 class="episode-title">"Admiral Peralta"</h3>
    <p>This is episode 10 of season 7 which is the 140th episode in the whole series. It was written by Neil Campbell and directed by Linda 
        Mendoza (IMDb, 2020).</p>
    <p>The episode starts with Jake and Amy announcing their pregnancy at the precinct. Their co-workers are not surprised though because Amy was
        not good at hiding it. The episode then follows the main plot where Jake invites his father, Roger, and estranged grandfather, Walter to 
        the gender reveal party. Their bonding time then turns chaotic when Roger and Walter accidentally drop the gender reveal cake. This causes 
        to the three men to try to clean up the cake blindfolded but that only makes things worse. The gender reveal ends up happening and more 
        chaos ensues. Towards the end of episode Jake surprises Amy with a smaller cake, since she didn't know what the baby's gender is, and they 
        find out that they're having a boy. (On the right is a clip from the episode).</p> 
    
    <p>This is my favourite episode because it is an amalgamation of all my favourite things about the show. It is funny, chaotic, it has some 
        lighthearted moments, and it is centered around Peraltiago (Jake & Amy's couple name). No matter how many times I watch the show, this 
        episode never gets old, and with each watch, I find something new to laugh at. In general, the episode was well-written and directed and 
        the actors gave very believable performances which led to my ultimate enjoyment.</p></div>
