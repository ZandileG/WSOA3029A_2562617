{
    name: "Jake Peralta",
    image: "content-images/Jake.png",
    portrayedBy: "Andy Samberg",
    occupation: "Detective",
    personality: `Jake is a charismatic character. He's funny, competitive, and always raises people's spirits with his jokes and pranks. What I 
                  like most about Jake is that he really cares about his friends and family and throughout the series we see him go from being 
                  immature to being a kind, loyal and thoughtful person.`,

{
    name: "Amy Santiago",
    image: "content-images/Amy.jpg",
    portrayedBy: "Melissa Fumero",
    occupation: "Sergeant",
    personality: `Amy is a very relatable character (well, to me at least). She's a know-it-all/nerd character who loves being organised and 
                  doing things by the book. She's also a bit of a teacher's pet because most of the things she does is to impress the captain. 
                  Overall, Amy is a great character and I like that she is not written as a one dimensional nerd character but there are layers 
                  to her personality.`,

{
    name: "Raymond Holt",
    image: "content-images/Holt.png",
    portrayedBy: "Andre Braugher",
    occupation: "Captain",
    personality: `Apart from Gina (on the next page) Captain Holt is my favourite character. He's a well-written, complex character with an amazing 
                  storyline throughout the series. He is a gay, black character, and I like that the writers did not make him a stereotypically 
                  flambouyant person nor did they make him a steroetypical "stern/scary" black man. They instead made him a funny, empathetic, 
                  and devoted character and his interactions with other characters are always a fun watch.`,

{
    name: "Gina Linetti",
    image: "content-images/Gina.png",
    portrayedBy: "Chelsea Peretti",
    occupation: "Assistant",
    personality: `Gina is my number one favourite character. She's very funny, a bit narcissistic, but overall she's a good person. Gina can also 
                  be a bit delusional at times but she exudes confidence that makes people believe the things she is saying even when she's lying. 
                  What I love most about this character is that she is unhinged. She does and says whatever she wants and people, usually, don't 
                  question her.`,
    quote: `"All men are at least 30% attracted to me. My mother cried the day I was born, because she knew she would never be better than me" - 
            S1 Episode 16.`,

{
    name: "Charles Boyle",
    image: "content-images/Charles.png",
    portrayedBy: "Joe Lo Truglio",
    occupation: "Detective",
    personality: `Charles is a really funny character. When I watch an episode of the show and he's on the screen, I just know that I will be 
                  laughing at any moment. I also enjoy his confidence in himself because he doesn't let anyone tell what him what he can't do 
                  even when we as the audience know that he actually can't do it. And lastly, I find his loyalty to Jake to be really sweet and 
                  his obsession with Jake and Amy's relationship super relatable.`,
    quote: `"What about me? What if something happens to Jake, and he never gets to meet my baby? I don't want to hang out with some stupid baby 
            who's never met Jake" - S3 Episode 23.`,
},

{
    name: "Rosa Diaz",
    image: "content-images/Rosa.png",
    portrayedBy: "Melissa Fumero",
    occupation: "Detective",
    personality: `Rosa is pretty chilled character. She likes being by herself and minding her own business and it's sometimes hard for her to 
                  trust people. Rosa is also a bisexual character and after she comes out she becomes more open around her friends and family. In 
                  general, I like how her character has grown throughout the seasons.`,
    quote: `"Two steps forward, one step  back is still one step  forward" - S6 Episode 8.`,

{
    name: "Terry Jeffords",
    image: "content-images/Terry.jpg",
    portrayedBy: "Terry Crews",
    occupation: "Lieutenent",
    personality: `Terry is a wholesome character. He really cares about his family and friends and when he's at work, he can't stop talking about 
                  his kids. Terry is also good at giving advice and always lends a helping hand when his co-workers need anything. What I enjoy 
                  most about Tery Jeffords is that this character is similar to the other comedic roles that Terry Crews has played before but he 
                  has more layers to his personality and actually feels like a real person not just an archetype.`,
