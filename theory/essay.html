    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>In this essay, I will do a critical analysis of the data journalism project titled, <q>The Shape 
        of Slavery</q>. It was created by Bill Rankin and Matt Daniels, who mapped out the data and 
        wrote the code, respectively. The data journalism project was published in January 2017 
        on The Pudding, which is a <q>digital publication that creates visual essays with data</q> (The 
        Pudding,  2024).  The  aim  of  the  project  is  to  show  the  connection  between  the  rate  of 
        incarceration and  the  population of slaves in  the American South (Rankin and Daniels, 
        2017).  This  is  illustrated  through  the  data  visualisation  and  further  expanded  in  its 
        accompanying article.</p>

    <h3>Data Visualisation Techniques</h3>
    <p>In <q>The Shape of Slavery</q> the data visualisation technique used is a dot map. Dot maps 
        or  dot  density  maps  use  the  dot  symbol  to  show <q>the  distribution  of  many  related 
        phenomena  in  geographical  space</q>  (Synergy  Codes,  2024).  In  this  data  journalism 
        project,  different  sized  dots  are  used  to  represent  the  number  of  incarcerated  people 
        across the United States as well as enslaved people in the deep South.</p>
    <figure><img src="theory-images/2.png" alt="Screenshot of the legend/key showing how population is represented">
        <figcaption>[Figure 2: Screenshot of the legend/key showing how population is represented]</figcaption></figure>

    <p>Other data visualisation techniques include <q>visual scalability, real-time interaction,
        and personalization</q> (Bikakis in Li, 2020, p.19). These will be expanded on in the later 
        sections but in general,  they speak to the visualisation being able to  effectively display 
        large amounts of data,  the user  being able to interact with  the  visuals, and them being 
        able to change to how  they view the data (Bikakis in Li, 2020, p.19).  The reason behind 
        these  choices  is  that  <q>big data is useful when it is represented in an accessible way</q>
        (Nkosi, 2020). It is unfathomable how many people were enslaved and incarcerated from 
        1790  to  2010;  therefore,  the  visualisation  helps  the  user  make  sense  of  these  large 
        numbers through its use of colour, patterns and shape language.</p>

    <h3>Interactivity and User Engagement</h3>
    <p>The  role  of  interactivity  in  this  project  is  to  communicate  with  the  user  and  keep  them 
        engaged  with  the  information  they  are  receiving.  The  interactions  available  to  the  user 
        are clicking, hovering, and scrolling. In the nav bar, when the user clicks inside a box, its 
        area is filled with a white colour. This action also changes the information displayed on 
        the  map,  depending  on  the  date  that  was  selected.  Also,  when  the  user  hovers  over  a 
        date, the text changes from white to blue.</p>
    <figure><img src="theory-images/3.png" alt="Screenshot showing the hover effect on the nav bar">
        <figcaption>[Figure 3: Screenshot showing the hover effect on the nav bar]</figcaption></figure>

    <figure><img src="theory-images/4.png" alt="Screenshot showing the hover effect on the map">
        <figcaption>[Figure 4: Screenshot showing the hover effect on the map]</figcaption></figure>
    
    <p>Hovering  is  also  available  on  the  map.  When  the  user  hovers  over  a  dot,  the  area 
        surrounding it gets highlighted and information is given about the number of people the 
        dot  represents.  While  clicking  and  hovering  are  based  on  what  the  user  wants  to  do  or 
        see,  scrolling  is  set  up  by  the  designers  to  automatically  take  the  user  through  the 
        visualisation and its different parts. This means that with each scroll, the user will be able 
        to  see  the  map  change  without  having  to  click  on  the  nav  bar.  These  interactions  are 
        effective because they show the user that their actions have an effect on the information 
        they receive.</p>

    <p>The impact of interactivity on user engagement is the creation of immersion and 
        intuitiveness. The user feels involved and present in the moment because they have the 
        agency to make changes. The interactive elements are also intuitive, for example, when 
        the  user  sees  the  buttons  on  the  nav  bar,  they  know  that  they  are  clickable.  Over  the 
        years, I have engaged with several data visualisations and most of them were static bar 
        graphs.  In  spite  of  the  use  of  colour  and  descriptive  labelling,  I  did  not  feel  like  I 
        understood what I was seeing or even cared about what it represents. This is because the 
        data was just given to me, and I was not able to interact with it or see it in a different light. 
        Therefore,  the  impact  of  interactivity  on  data  interpretation  and  comprehension  is  that 
        users are not just passive consumers, but they are active in obtaining knowledge.</p>

    <h3>UI/UX Design Principles </h3>
    <p>The  UI/UX  design  principles  present  in  this  data  visualisation  are  <q>clarity,  simplicity, 
        consistency,  feedback,  usability,  hierarchy,  and  accessibility</q>  (Direduryan,  2023).  The 
        information displayed in the visualisation, is clear and easy to understand, also, the map, 
        nav bar, and legends have simple designs. The colour scheme and layout are consistent, 
        even when the map’s data changes, and the user gets feedback each time they interact 
        with the UI elements i.e. the text colour changes when hovering on a date in the nav bar. 
        The  visualisation  is  usable,  because  it  does  not  have  any  no  errors  or  unconventional 
        interactions. In terms of hierarchy, the most important part of the project is the map, and 
        it takes up the most space on the page. Another important part is the nav bars and they 
        also take up a large amount of space in the top left corner. The least important part is the 
        legends,  and  they  are  the  smallest  elements  on  the  screen. Lastly,  this  project  is 
        accessible  because  it has  a  dark  background  so  it will be easy on the user’s eyes. It is 
        also accessible to users with different types of colour blindness (see Figures 5-8).</p>

    <p>These UI/UX techniques have significantly influenced the way I interacted with the data 
        and informed my understanding of it. By having a clear visual hierarchy,  I knew what to 
        focus on and what to ignore. By having a consistent layout and colour scheme I was able 
        to understand the relationship between the slave populations of 1860 and the population 
        of  incarcerated  people  in  2010.  This  is  because  the  colours  of  the  dots  remained  the 
        same, so it was easy to build that connection, also, each time the map’s data changed, 
        the layout remained the same. In general, I found the project to be visually appealing and 
        it was able to understand the data, which gave me a good user experience.</p>

    <h3>Data-Driven Storytelling</h3>
    <p>This  project  combines  narrative  elements  with  data-driven  storytelling  in  the  way  it 
        represents the black population and state prisoners for each year. Population is 
        represented by the coloured dots and state prisoners are represented by white circles on 
        the map. As seen in Figures 10 and 11, the number of state prisoners was relatively low 
        in 1910, with the highest being 172, and the number kept increasing until 2010, where the 
        highest  was  868.  This  creates  the  narrative  that  the  states  with  the  highest  number  of 
        slaves, eventually had the highest black population, and it is where most prisoners are 
        found.  This  is  further  illustrated  in  Figures  12  and  13,  where  12  shows  the  number  of 
        prisoners  across  races  and  13  shows  the  number  of  black  prisoners  and,  in  each  one, 
        the highest number of prisoners can be seen in the South.</p>

        <img src="theory-images/10.png" alt="Screenshot showing the number of prisoners in 2010">
        <figcaption>[Figure 9 & 10: Screenshots showing the number of prisoners in 1910 and 2010]</figcaption></figure>

        <figcaption>[Figure 11 & 12: Screenshots showing the number of prisoners and the number of black prisoners in 2010, respectively]</figcaption></figure>

    <p>Overall, the importance of narrative in communicating complex information is to make it 
        easy for the user to remember. I was able to remember and understand the significance 
        of the data because the project represented it with colours and circles, and I would not 
        have  been  able  to  do  so  had  I  just  read  the  accompanying  article.  This  is  because “by 
        making the data we want to show, relevant to our audience, it becomes a pivotal point in 
        our story” (Knaflic, 2015, p.185).</p>

    <h3>Emotional Impact</h3>
    <p>The  colour  palette  used  in  the  data  visualisation  contributes  to  the  serious  tone  of  the 
        project  and  the  overall  message.  Firstly,  the  background  colour  of  the  visualisation  is 
        navy blue, therefore, it sets up a dark tone or mood for the user. In the legend, the colours 
        blue,  purple,  orange,  pink,  and  yellow  represent  the  number  of  black  inmates.  These 
        colours, besides blue, are described as warm colours and they are conventionally used 
        to  denote  danger.  Therefore,  their  use  in  this  project,  will  show  the  user  that  they  are 
        representing something negative as opposed to cool, pastel colours that might represent 
        something  light  and  positive.  In  a  way,  the  <q>designers  [settled]  for  establishing  the 
        context for an emotion rather than the emotion itself</q> (Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, 2006, 
        p.94).  This  means  that  instead  of  expecting  users  to  understand  the  severity  of  the 
        numbers,  they  associated  them  with  colours  so  that  users  can  make  connections 
        between their understanding of the colour, and the number it represents.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In the analysis of “The Shape of Slavery” I learnt that data visualisation is not just about 
        displaying  appealing  visuals,  but  it  is  also  about  constructing  meaning  or  conveying  a 
        narrative.  I  also  learnt  that  there  should  be  a  clear  relationship  between  the  different 
        elements  i.e.  the  shapes,  colours,  numbers  and  the  graph/map  should  communicate 
        with each other. These insights will be applied to  my own data visualisation projects in 
        the future by guiding me not to spend too much time on aesthetics and actually focus on 
        storytelling and meaning-making.</p>
