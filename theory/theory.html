            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>In this essay, I will do a critical analysis of the data journalism project titled, <q>The Shape of Slavery</q>. It was created 
                by Bill Rankin and Matt Daniels, who mapped out the data and wrote the code, respectively. The data journalism project was 
                published in January 2017 on The Pudding, which is a <q>digital publication that creates visual essays with data</q> (The 
                Pudding,  2024).  The  aim  of  the  project  is  to  show  the  connection  between  the  rate  of incarceration and  the  
                population of slaves in  the American South (Rankin and Daniels, 2017).  This  is  illustrated  through  the  data  
                visualisation  and  further  expanded  in  its accompanying article.</p>
        
            <h3>Data Visualisation Techniques</h3>
            <p>In <q>The Shape of Slavery</q> the data visualisation technique used is a dot map. Dot maps or  dot  density  maps  use  the  
                dot  symbol  to  show <q>the  distribution  of  many  related phenomena  in  geographical  space</q>  (Synergy  Codes,  2024).  
                In  this  data  journalism project,  different  sized  dots  are  used  to  represent  the  number  of  incarcerated  people 
                across the United States as well as enslaved people in the deep South.</p>
            <figure><img class="figure1" src="theory-images/2.png" alt="Screenshot of the legend/key showing how population is represented">
                <figcaption>[Figure 2: Screenshot of the legend/key showing how population is represented]</figcaption></figure>
        
            <p>Other data visualisation techniques include <q>visual scalability, real-time interaction, and personalization</q> (Bikakis in 
                Li, 2020, p.19). These will be expanded on in the later sections but in general,  they speak to the visualisation being able 
                to effectively display large amounts of data,  the user  being able to interact with  the  visuals, and them being able to 
                change to how  they view the data (Bikakis in Li, 2020, p.19).  The reason behind these  choices  is  that  <q>big data is 
                useful when it is represented in an accessible way</q> (Nkosi, 2020). It is unfathomable how many people were enslaved and 
                incarcerated from 1790  to  2010;  therefore,  the  visualisation  helps  the  user  make  sense  of  these  large numbers 
                through its use of colour, patterns and shape language.</p>
        
            <h3>Interactivity and User Engagement</h3>
            <p>The  role  of  interactivity  in  this  project  is  to  communicate  with  the  user  and  keep  them engaged  with  the  
                information  they  are  receiving.  The  interactions  available  to  the  user are clicking, hovering, and scrolling. In the 
                nav bar, when the user clicks inside a box, its area is filled with a white colour. This action also changes the information 
                displayed on the  map,  depending  on  the  date  that  was  selected.  Also,  when  the  user  hovers  over  a date, the text 
                changes from white to blue.</p>
            <figure><img class="figure2" src="theory-images/3.png" alt="Screenshot showing the hover effect on the nav bar">
                <figcaption>[Figure 3: Screenshot showing the hover effect on the nav bar]</figcaption></figure>

            <p>Hovering  is  also  available  on  the  map.  When  the  user  hovers  over  a  dot,  the  area surrounding it gets 
                highlighted and information is given about the number of people the dot  represents.  While  clicking  and  hovering  are  
                based  on  what  the  user  wants  to  do  or see,  scrolling  is  set  up  by  the  designers  to  automatically  take  
                the  user  through  the visualisation and its different parts. This means that with each scroll, the user will be able to
                see  the  map  change  without  having  to  click  on  the  nav  bar.  These  interactions  are effective because they show 
                the user that their actions have an effect on the information they receive.</p>

            <figure><img class="figure3" src="theory-images/4.png" alt="Screenshot showing the hover effect on the map">
                <figcaption>[Figure 4: Screenshot showing the hover effect on the map]</figcaption></figure>
        
            <p>The impact of interactivity on user engagement is the creation of immersion and intuitiveness. The user feels involved and 
                present in the moment because they have the agency to make changes. The interactive elements are also intuitive, for example, 
                when the  user  sees  the  buttons  on  the  nav  bar,  they  know  that  they  are  clickable.  Over  the years, I have 
                engaged with several data visualisations and most of them were static bar graphs.  In  spite  of  the  use  of  colour  and  
                descriptive  labelling,  I  did  not  feel  like  I understood what I was seeing or even cared about what it represents. This 
                is because the data was just given to me, and I was not able to interact with it or see it in a different light. Therefore,  
                the  impact  of  interactivity  on  data  interpretation  and  comprehension  is  that users are not just passive consumers, 
                but they are active in obtaining knowledge.</p>
        
            <h3>UI/UX Design Principles </h3>
            <p>The  UI/UX  design  principles  present  in  this  data  visualisation  are  <q>clarity,  simplicity, consistency,  feedback,  
                usability,  hierarchy,  and  accessibility</q>  (Direduryan,  2023).  The information displayed in the visualisation, is clear 
                and easy to understand, also, the map, nav bar, and legends have simple designs. The colour scheme and layout are consistent, 
                even when the map’s data changes, and the user gets feedback each time they interact with the UI elements i.e. the text colour 
                changes when hovering on a date in the nav bar. The  visualisation  is  usable,  because  it  does  not  have  any  no  errors  
                or  unconventional interactions. In terms of hierarchy, the most important part of the project is the map, and it takes up the 
                most space on the page. Another important part is the nav bars and they also take up a large amount of space in the top left 
                corner. The least important part is the legends,  and  they  are  the  smallest  elements  on  the  screen. Lastly,  this  
                project  is accessible  because  it has  a  dark  background  so  it will be easy on the user’s eyes. It is also accessible to 
                users with different types of colour blindness (see Figures 5-8).</p>

            </div>

            <p>These UI/UX techniques have significantly influenced the way I interacted with the data and informed my understanding of it. By 
                having a clear visual hierarchy,  I knew what to focus on and what to ignore. By having a consistent layout and colour scheme 
                I was able to understand the relationship between the slave populations of 1860 and the population of  incarcerated  people  in  
                2010.  This  is  because  the  colours  of  the  dots  remained  the same, so it was easy to build that connection, also, each 
                time the map’s data changed, the layout remained the same. In general, I found the project to be visually appealing and it was 
                able to understand the data, which gave me a good user experience.</p>
        
            <h3>Data-Driven Storytelling</h3>
            <p>This  project  combines  narrative  elements  with  data-driven  storytelling  in  the  way  it represents the black population 
                and state prisoners for each year. Population is represented by the coloured dots and state prisoners are represented by white 
                circles on the map. As seen in Figures 10 and 11, the number of state prisoners was relatively low in 1910, with the highest 
                being 172, and the number kept increasing until 2010, where the highest  was  868.  This  creates  the  narrative  that  the  
                states  with  the  highest  number  of slaves, eventually had the highest black population, and it is where most prisoners are 
                found.  This  is  further  illustrated  in  Figures  12  and  13,  where  12  shows  the  number  of prisoners  across  races  
                and  13  shows  the  number  of  black  prisoners  and,  in  each  one, the highest number of prisoners can be seen in the 
                South.</p>
            
            <div class="side-by-side">
            <figure><img class="figure4" src="theory-images/9.png" alt="Screenshot showing the number of prisoners in 1910">

                <figcaption>[Figure 11 & 12: Screenshots showing the number of prisoners and the number of black prisoners in 2010, 
                    respectively]</figcaption></figure>
            </div>
            <p>Overall, the importance of narrative in communicating complex information is to make it easy for the user to remember. I was 
                able to remember and understand the significance of the data because the project represented it with colours and circles, and 
                I would not have  been  able  to  do  so  had  I just  read  the  accompanying  article.  This  is  because “by making the 
                data we want to show, relevant to our audience, it becomes a pivotal point in our story” (Knaflic, 2015, p.185).</p>
        
            <h3>Emotional Impact</h3>
            <p>The  colour  palette  used  in  the  data  visualisation  contributes  to  the  serious  tone  of the project and the  overall  
                message.  Firstly,  the  background  colour  of  the  visualisation  is navy blue, therefore, it sets up a dark tone or mood 
                for the user. In the legend, the colours blue,  purple,  orange,  pink,  and  yellow  represent  the  number  of  black  
                inmates.  These colours, besides blue, are described as warm colours and they are conventionally used to  denote  danger.  
                Therefore,  their  use  in  this  project,  will  show  the  user  that  they  are representing something negative as opposed 
                to cool, pastel colours that might represent something  light  and  positive.  In  a  way,  the  <q>designers  [settled]  for  
                establishing  the context for an emotion rather than the emotion itself</q> (Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, 2006, p.94).  This  
                means  that  instead  of  expecting  users  to  understand  the  severity  of  the numbers,  they  associated  them  with  
                colours  so  that  users  can  make  connections between their understanding of the colour, and the number it represents.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In the analysis of “The Shape of Slavery” I learnt that data visualisation is not just about displaying  appealing  visuals,  
                but  it  is  also  about  constructing  meaning  or  conveying  a narrative.  I  also  learnt  that  there  should  be  a  
                clear  relationship  between  the  different elements  i.e.  the  shapes,  colours,  numbers  and  the  graph/map  should  
                communicate with each other. These insights will be applied to  my own data visualisation projects in the future by guiding 
                me not to spend too much time on aesthetics and actually focus on storytelling and meaning-making.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This year, I learnt a lot about web development. When I started Interactive Media, I felt confident because I had prior knowledge 
                about HTML and CSS. However, in Semester 1, I realised that what I knew about making websites was very limited and at times 
                incorrect. I learnt that HTML files must be formatted with the correct semantic markup and my website is not just meant to look 
                pretty but it also needs to be functional, responsive, and accessible. In Semester 2, I learnt that the user is a very important 
                part of the design process. Everything I do, as the designer, should be aligned with the kind of experience I want users to have. 
                After working on my Brooklyn Nine-Nine fan website, I believe that I have grown in my skills as a designer and programmer. In 
                this essay I reflect on my design process, the challenges I faced, and overall, what I learnt about being a web developer.</p>

            <h3>Global Economics and Artistic Implications</h3>
            <p>When building my website, I prioritized two global economic factors: sustainability and accessibility. For sustainability, I made 
                sure that a majority of my images and videos have small file sizes. This is because having a small file size reduces the amount 
                of mobile data consumed by the website, which means that the user won’t have to spend lots of money to buy extra data. It also 
                helps the user save electricity because it reduces the amount of power that is consumed by their device. However, the implication 
                of this is that my images and videos will have lost a bit of visual quality.</p>

            <p>For accessibility, people from all over the world will be able to find my website because I used Technical and On-Page Search 
                Engine Optimization (SEO). With Technical SEO my website loads relatively quickly, it has a secure URL scheme (https) and it's 
                fully responsive (Pol, 2023). I used On-Page SEO in my HTML files so that all images to have descriptive names, title tags and 
                alt tags. Also, in each HTML file I used metadata, header tags and correct semantic markup (Lyons, 2022). The implication of 
                this is that my website has a good layout which will remain consistent across multiple devices and web browsers. Altogether, 
                these techniques made my website globally sustainable and accessible.</p>

            <h3>UI/UX Decisions</h3>
            <h4>Meaning-making</h4>
            <p>My website has a minimalist design. It uses only two fonts, has a simple, intuitive navigation, and I only used animations for 
                specific contexts such as, hover effects, glow effects and page flips. My website also uses margins and white space so that the 
                user is not overloaded by seeing too many elements on the screen. Furthermore, for my colour palette, I used four main colours, 
                navy blue, brown, yellow, and tan. The darker colours (blue and brown) are used for the headers and footers and the lightest 
                colour (tan) is used for the page backgrounds. This is so that the page content is visible and readable as well as to make the 
                different sections distinguishable from each other. Yellow is a light colour and at times visually inaccessible therefore, I made 
                sure not to overuse it and only use it for the logo and as an active page indicator on the nav menu. Altogether, these UI 
                elements will give the user a good experience because the website content will be accessible and understandable, and they will 
                find the website familiar when they notice things they have seen from other websites.</p>

            <p>My data visualisations also have a good use of Information Architecture. The data in each graph is organised by colour, size and 
                category. This helps the user understand that if a data point is orange, it is related to the other orange ones or if a circle is 
                larger than the others, it represents a large amount of data. This is similar to the labels, tooltips, and keys. In my 
                scatterplot graph, the labels tell the user what each axis represents i.e. the y-axis has ratings and the x-axis has the number 
                of episodes in the series. The tooltips help the user make sense of the data. While going through the graph, the user can hover 
                over a dot and find out what episode it represents, what season it falls under, and what rating it has. The key then helps the 
                user make sense of the graph as a whole i.e. brown represents plot points for Season 1 and yellow represents Season 2 etc. Lastly, 
                my data visualisations also have a navigation system. Instead of having to look at the entire graph, users can search for an 
                episode number, a season, or a rating and that information will be highlighted. This means that the user will be able to make 
                sense of the graph, and the information presented to them without feeling confused or overwhelmed.</p>

            <h4>Engagement</h4>
            <p>I used bold colours for my homepage to capture the user’s attention and to make them eager to see more. On the other pages, I used 
                softer/lighter colours to avoid overstimulating the user with too many bold colours. On each page, I also added images to accompany 
                paragraphs. The images are meant to illustrate certain points made in the text such as diagrams or screenshots in the Design and 
                Theory pages. These keep the user engaged because if the user becomes desensitised from seeing lots of text, they will have 
                something more interesting to look at. With my data visualisations, users become engaged by the use of colour, the shape language 
                as well as other interactive features that will be expanded on in the next section. Overall, on my website, I keep users engaged 
                by piquing their interest and giving them a chance to take breaks from reading lots of text.</p>

            <h3>Interactivity</h3>
            <h4>The entire website</h4>
            <p>Interactivity plays a huge role in my website. It allows users to be active participants instead of just passively consuming the 
                content. The first point of interaction that users can find is the nav menu. This gives the user the ability to click on a 
                specific tab and open the page that corresponds to that section. Before they even click on the tab, while they are still hovering, 
                the text element goes from white to grey. This shows them that their action was acknowledged and once they click on it, the text 
                turns yellow to indicate that they have successfully opened the page. The next points of interaction are the social media icons 
                found on the footer of each page. When the user hovers over an icon, it has a white glow and when they click on it; it opens a 
                social media page that corresponds to that icon. The next point of interaction is the newsletter subscription form found on the 
                About Page. Users are able to enter their information and submit the form to subscribe to my newsletter. While entering their 
                information, they will receive alerts so that they can fix any errors, and they will also be notified for a successful submission. 
                This interaction involves a lot of communication with the user which shows them that their actions are valued, and they can 
                affect change within the website.</p>

            <h4>The Data Visualisations</h4>
            <p>The last points of interaction are the buttons found in my bubble chart and the key from my scatterplot graph. Firstly, my bubble 
                chart has a “combine” and “split” button and these are used to split the bubbles (seasons) according to the number 
                episodes they have as well as move all the bubbles closer together, repectively. This is interactive because the user’s actions are 
                changing the chart. It also helps them interpret the data because if for some reason the user cannot see the colours, that 
                visually group the bubbles, the buttons help them make that connection. Lastly, in my scatterplot graph, the user is able to 
                hover on a circle in the key, and the plot points that correspond with it will be in colour while the rest of the graph has 
                reduced in opacity. This is useful because the graph has lots of dots and colours so being able to select which data to focus on 
                helps the user understand what they are seeing.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <h4>Creating the Data Visualisations</h4>
            <p>The first challenge I faced when making my website was creating the data visualisations. This was really difficult because I was 
                used to following tutorials from class and I never got the time to practice on my own. I knew how to fetch data from the API and 
                the style the svg but I was unsure of how to actually create the visualisation. Therefore, to create the bubble chart and 
                scatterplot graph for Assignment 3, I relied heavily on YouTube videos and the code that we created from our tutorials in class. 
                After watching all these videos and referring back to the class content, I was able to create the third data visualisation 
                (heatmap) on my own. I did, however, refer to YouTube to learn how to add additional things such as the search field and how to 
                animate my data. This challenge taught me that practice is really important because the more I practice something, the better I 
                am when it’s time to actually do it.</p>

            <h4>Creatig a Narrative</h4>
            <p>The second challenge I faced was creating a narrative for my data visualisations. In my bubble chart for Assignment 3, I wanted to 
                show that Brooklyn Nine-Nine had lots of episodes. I did this by having bubble size represent seasons and their number of 
                episodes. I also added a split and combine button which brought the bubbles closer or apart from each other. Visually, the chart 
                made sense but there wasn’t really an emergent narrative. Therefore, for the final version of the chart, I decided to put these 
                buttons to use. When the split button is clicked, the bubbles, separate according to their ratings and when the combine button is 
                clicked, the bubbles with the same number of episodes move closer together. This creates the narrative that seasons with many 
                episodes have the highest ratings meaning that, the later seasons of Brooklyn Nine-Nine had lower ratings because they had fewer 
                episodes.</p>
            
            <h4>Full Responsive Design</h4>
            <p>The final challenge that I faced when developing my website was making it fully responsive. Generally, responsive design is not 
                difficult for me because I know how to use media queries and the developer tools. However, I used to find it easy because I could 
                only focus on three screen sizes. I had a preferred desktop and tablet size and for the mobile I used my phone’s specifications 
                so that I’ll be able to view my website from it. However, because we have to make our websites fully responsive, I knew that I 
                would have to do a lot of work. Therefore, I looked for techniques to make the process less tedious and more effective. I found 
                out that I can first reduce the size of the body so that everything within it can fit its new context. I can then reduce the 
                margins by 50% for tablets and 25% for phones. I also learnt that images should be set to 100% so that they can automatically 
                resize themselves (My website's responsiveness ends at 300px). Overall, these tips made my responsive design process easier and a 
                bit faster than before.</p>

            <h3>Professional Practices</h3>
            <p>After reflecting on my process and all the design decisions that I made, I firmly believe that my website aligns with professional 
                practices in international web development. According to a blog post from the Software Development company, TatvaSoft, the best 
                practices for professional web development are:</p>

            <ol>
            <li>A Good Navigation System</li> 
            <li>Keeping Everything Separate - CSS, HTML, and JavaScript</li>
            <li>Writing Smart Codes</li>
            <li>Testing While You Build</li>
            <li>Having Good Performance/Speed</li>
            <li>Maintaining the Standards</li>
            <li>Considering Compatibility Across Multiple Devices</li>
            <li>Providing a Great UX (Sharma, 2022)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>My website has met all of these requirements. I have a good navigation system that users will find intuitive. My HTML, CSS, and 
                JavaScript code are separated, and I also provided comments to explain what I wanted to do. While building my website, I kept 
                checking to see if things were working and I regularly uploaded my changes to GitHub. Moreover, my website content and images are 
                optimised so my site loads quickly. My website follows the conventions of a regular website such as having a logo and menu at the 
                top and a footer at the bottom, therefore, users will find it familiar. Lastly, my website is fully responsive so users from all 
                over the world will be able to use it. All of these come together to provide a good user experience, and this shows that my 
                website does align with professional practices for web development.</p>
