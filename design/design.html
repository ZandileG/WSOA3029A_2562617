    <h3>User Alignment</h3>
    <p>My goal is that I want my website to be innovative, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. Even though it might have familiar features, 
        I want people to find my website unique. I want them to find it easy to use and for every aspect to work the way I planned it to. And 
        the most important thing is, I want them to see it as organised and creative. I want people who view my website to look at the way I 
        structure my pages and the colour schemes I use and see it as familiar. But, I also want them to be impressed at the little breaks of
        convention that I will use to make my website creative and unique. I want my users to explore every single page, hyperlink, and tab that 
        I use on my website. This is so that they have the full experience and they see all the work that I put into it. My target audience, for 
        now, is our lecturer for this course. I know that she has access to a computer and has experience in web development so she will be able 
        to view my website and when some things don't pan out the way I wanted them to, she might be able to figure out what went wrong. 
        Eventually, my target audience will be potential employers in the industry of animation ad web development. This will be my new target 
        audience because when applying for jobs, I will need to submit my CV and portfolio so they would need to see my website. This means that 
        I have to modify my website, check it for errors, and make it ready to submit for applications and interviews. I assume that potential 
        employers won't have a lot of time on their hands so the website has to be easy to navigate, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. 
        This is because when the website is easy to navigate, it won't be difficult to view it, when it is functional, they won't have any 
        issues or have to send me emails requesting a functional website, and when it is aesthetically pleasing they will see that I am creative 
        person. Potential employers, I also assume, want to see who I am as an individual and how I differ from other applicants so I will make 
        sure that my profile page is very detailed and that my portfolio page is a representation of my best work.</p>
