    <h2>Iteraction Design</h2>
    <h3>User Alignment</h3>
    <p class="ixd">My goal is to make a fully functional website that is also aesthetically pleasing. I want users to find my website different 
        from other websites they have used and also find each point of interaction intuitive. In general, I hope the users have a good experience 
        when exploring the website and I hope they get inspired/convinced to give <cite>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</cite> a watch. My target audience is 
        teens and young adults. The website can still be enjoyed by people who are not part of this target audience but I specifically chose 
        these groups of people because they are the general demographic that is interested in tv shows and fandoms. They participate in forums, 
        conventions and on social media platforms for their fandom so this website will be right up their alley.</p>

        <h3>Information Structure</h3>

        <h3>User Flow</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">This is the order in which the user can go through the website.</p>

        <img class="interaction-points" src="design-images/Interaction Points.png" alt="Image of the interaction points">

        <h3>Interface Elements</h3>
        <p class="ixd">Input controls: I have added a text field with a submit button for users to leave me a message or contact me. This is located at in the 
            Profile page. It doesn't actually receive any messages because I learnt that such is done through PHP. I don't know how to use PHP code 
            so I didn't want to waste time learning how to do it when it is not required for the exam. However, I will learn how to use PHP when I 
            start using my website outside of the course. Informational Components: I have added pop-up message that appears in the different 
            homepages for each section. This message informs the user that the section images/cards are clickable. When clicked, it opens the page 
            to that section. Navigational Components: I have added a reading progress bar at the top of the blog pages. This shows the reader how 
            far they are in reading the blog post.</p>
