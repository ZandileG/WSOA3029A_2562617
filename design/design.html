    <h1>Design</h1>
    <h3>User Alignment</h3>
    <p class="ixd">My goal is to make a fully functional website that is also aesthetically pleasing. I want users to find my website different 
        from other websites they have used and to also find each point of interaction intuitive. In general, I hope the users have a good 
        experience when using the website and I hope they get inspired/convinced to give <cite>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</cite> a watch. My target 
        audience is teens and young adults. The website can still be enjoyed by people who are not part of this target audience but I 
        specifically chose these groups of people because they are the general demographic that is interested in tv shows and fandoms. They 
        participate in forums, conventions and on social media platforms for their different fandoms therefore, this website will be right up 
        their alley.</p>

        <h3>Information Structure</h3>
        <img class="information-structure" src="design-images/Information Structure.png" alt="Image of the information structure">

        <h3>Interface Elements</h3>
        <ul class="ixd">      
        <li>Navigational Components: I added "next" and "previous" buttons at the bottom of each page. These will help the user navigate 
            the website without needing to use the nav menu at the top of the page. Also, on the homepage, I added glowing text that says "Start". 
            When clicked, it takes the user to the next page (About). The user can still use the menu but this is just a fun interaction point 
            when the user lands on the website.</li>

        <li>Informational Components: On the Fan Art page I added tooltips that show the artists' names when the user overs over each image. 
            I also used tooltips for the data visualisations. When the user hovers over a section/point on the visualisation, a description 
            for that item will appear. Another component that I added is a reading progress bar for pages that have a lot of information such as 
            the Design and Theory pages. When the user scrolls up, the progress bar will increase, and when they scroll down, the bar will 
            decrease. This will indicate to the user how far they are in reading/exploring those pages.</li>

        <li>Input controls: I added a return to top button. This allows the user to go back to the top of the page without having to scroll. 
            I also added a flip page button for the Characters page so that the user can go through all the characters and remain at the 
            same place without having to scroll down the page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>User Flow</h3>
        <img class="user-flow" src="design-images/User Flow.png" alt="Image of the user flow">

        <p class="small">There are just a few ways to show the order in which the user can go through the website. They have to start on the 
            homepage and from there they can explore it anyhow. However, option 1 (red) is how I would like them to explore it and this is the way 
            the navigation menu and buttons have been arranged.</p>

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <img class="style-guide" src="design-images/Style Guide.png" alt="Image of Style Guide">
        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>

        <ul class="ixd">
        <li>I chose my colour palette based on the Brooklyn Nine-Nine images that I found. I found an image with a navy blue background that I 
            used for my homwpage, an image with a cream white/tan background that I used for the About page, as well as character images with 
            yellow backgrounds. I liked these colours so much because they evoke a serious (navy blue) but cheerful (yellow) mood and that is what 
            the show is. I then chose grey and brown because they complimented the aforementioned colours.</li>

        <li>For my logo, I used Brooklyn Nine-Nine's logo and I added the words "Fan Website" below it. This was a way to show/describe what kind 
            of website it is and also show that it is not the offical website for the show.</li>

        <li>With the menu items, I chose to add a box shadow for each rectangle because it makes the menu look more interresting. I have also not 
            seen any websites that have a menu like this so it makes my website stand out. I Without the box shadow, the menu looks flat and my 
            website looks more like a form of practice instead of the official commercial-grade that we are supposed to produce.</li>

        <li>The social media icons are used in the footer of each page. The close and open menu icons are used for the sidebar when the website is 
            viewed on a mobile screen. The flip page button is used on the Characters page to turn the page and view another character.</li>
            
        <li>The buttons have rounded borders to compliment the light-hearted, friendly mood of my website. The icons within the buttons are an 
            arrow pointing up, and two arrows facing left and right. These are meant to be intuitive and familiar to the user because it is 
            conventional for left to illustrate going back and right to illustrate going forward.</li>

        <li>For my fonts, I used the <cite><a href="https://fontjoy.com/">Fontjoy</a></cite> website and it helped me pair the <code>Fira Sans</code> 
            font with the <code>Nunito</code> font. Both these fonts are readable and they also contribute to the friendly atmosphere that I want my 
            website to evoke. This is because they have rounded edges and generally and generally appear fun not serious.</li>

        <li>The text alignment was based on me wanting my website to be readable and neat. The logo is right lighted at the top of each page, 
            centered headings look good above paragraphs or images and paragraphs look neat and readable when justified.</li>
        </ul>
