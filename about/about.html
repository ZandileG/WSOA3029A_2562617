    <h3 class="about-info">Background Information</h3>
    <p class="about-info"><cite>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</cite> is an American police sitcom/television series that aired on Fox, and later on NBC, 
        from the 17th of September 2013 to the 16th of September 2021. It was created by Dan Goor and Michael Schur and has a total of eight 
        seasons and 153 episodes. The show revolves around the police at a New York City Police Department (NYPD) who are adjusting to life 
        under their new commanding officer, Captain Raymond Holt (Wikipedia).</p>

    <h3 class="about-info">Significance</h3>
    <p class="about-info">The most important thing about this show is that it is a really good form of representation. Four out of seven people 
        in the main cast are people of colour. There are two Black men and two Latina women. The show also has queer reprepresentation with one 
        character being a gay man and another, a bisexual woman. All these characters are well written and relatable, they are a joy to 
        watch, and the stories they tell are sure to make you laugh or warm your heart.</p>
    <p class="about-info">That is why I created this website. I want to share my love for the show with others. If you have watched the show, I 
        want you to compare my favourite moments with yours and if you haven't watched it, I want to convince you to give it a try. I also created 
        this website because while, <cite>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</cite> is a popular TV show, I didn't find any fan sites about it (besides its Wiki 
        Fandom page). Therefore, I get to do whatever I want without worrying about what's already out there.</p>
